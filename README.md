# Project
This is an Emotion Recognition project with Convolutional Neural Networks.

#Description
Undoubtedly, the growing interaction between people and machines in everyday life necessitates a better understanding of human feelings on the part of machines. In this Τhesis, an attempt has been made to categorize emotions based on the physical characteristics of the person in one of the seven main categories: anger, contempt, fear, happiness, disgust, sadness, and surprise using Convolutional Neural Networks. This Τhesis contains analysis of various preprocessing techniques applied on images in order to prepare the data as an appropriate input to the Convolutional Neural Network. The research then focuses on the creation of a Convolutional Neural Network model from scratch capable of classifying emotions efficiently. Finally, all results are analyzed and examined thoroughly.
